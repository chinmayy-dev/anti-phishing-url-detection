This week focused on building and validating an end-to-end phishing URL detection pipeline.

Completed:

- Engineered lexical URL features (entropy, dot count, IP detection, keyword count)
- Constructed a labeled dataset (~400 rows)
- Implemented train/test split (80/20)
- Trained Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall
- Added cross-validation
- Tested robustness with IP-based phishing examples

Key Observations:

- Phishing URLs tend to be longer and have higher entropy.
- Dot and hyphen counts contribute meaningfully.
- Dataset balance is important for fair evaluation.

Improvements Made:

- Normalized URL parsing to handle missing scheme.
- Cleaned folder structure.
- Improved variable naming.
- Added reproducibility using random_state.

Next Steps:

- Interpret feature importance.
- Compare additional 2-3 models.
- Write a clean evaluation summary.
